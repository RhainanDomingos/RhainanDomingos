### About Me

I'm an iOS developer with a strong foundation in Computer Science, passionate about creating high-quality applications. My experience as a Systems Analyst at TOTVS provided me with a deep understanding of business logic and system architecture, which I now apply to native iOS development. I am proficient in Swift, UIKit, and modern architectures, always seeking to learn and improve my skills.
